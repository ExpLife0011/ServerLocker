此项目为Windows二级加锁系统，可以在您离开的时候保护您的计算机。
本项目遵循GPL3.0开源协议，归YxomTech所有，
现在在持续更新，添加更多安全功能。
本程序需要依赖OpenSSL库，暂时只支持x64系统。
为了为x64系统提供完成的功能，我使用了以下架构：

Run(x86) -> SLDaemon(x86)<-(X86 HOOK) -> ServerLock(x64) -> 直接操作系统

已修复日志系统漏洞！
Fixed Log System Bug!

This item is a Windows secondary locking system that protects your computer when you leave.
The project follows the GPL3.0 open source agreement, owned by YxomTech,
Now continue to update, add more security features.
The program needs to rely on OpenSSL library, temporarily only support x64 system.
In order to provide the finished functionality for the x64 system, I used the following architecture:

Run (x86) -> SLDaemon (x86) <-(X86 HOOK) -> ServerLock (x64) -> Direct Operating System

If there is no accident, the project will stop to 10.1. There are two reasons: First, in order to better imagine the next big version of the update; Second, because of academic factors. Have any questions can still contact me. In order to express apology, we choose to temporarily open source, thank you for your understanding!

The next major update may add voice recognition and enable the registry to save the password, so stay tuned.


Last Version: 0.1c


THANKS FOR YOUR SUPPORT!!!
